# Below The Arithmetical Mean
# When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original listâ€™s arithmetical mean.
# The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
# Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]

def arith_mean(ary):

    mean = sum / len(ary)
    for i in range(0, len(ary)):
        if ary[i] < mean:
           lower.append(ary[i])
    return (sum, mean, lower)
print(arith_mean([1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3]))



# Two Lowest Elements
# When given a list of elements, find the two lowest elements.
# They can be equal to each other or different.
# Example: [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2], Return: 2, 3
